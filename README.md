# ISAP

[ISAP](https://isap.iaik.tugraz.at) is a family of lightweight authenticated encryption algorithms designed with a focus on **robustness against implementation attacks** and reached the final round of the [NIST Standardization Process for Lightweight Cryptography](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/lightweight-cryptography/finalists) (2019-2023). ISAP is of particular interest for applications like firmware updates where **robustness against power analysis and fault attacks** is crucial while code size and a small footprint in hardware matters. ISAP's original version was published at [FSE 2017](https://tosc.iacr.org/index.php/ToSC/article/view/585).
